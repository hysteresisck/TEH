Comprised of Alpharetta’s leading technology companies, both large and small, the members are charged with identifying and pursuing key investment opportunities and policy decisions for Alpharetta’s technology companies and its burgeoning technology industry.</span></p><p style="margin:0"><span>The City of Alpharetta is home to nearly 600 technology companies, making up 35% of Where Georgia Leads technology companies. The city also houses over a quarter of Metro Atlanta’s top 25 technology employers, resulting in the city’s daytime working population exceeding that of residents. With one the most robust and redundant fibre and power fibre infrastructure networks in the south-east, Alpharetta has been a central hub for new and relocating technology companies. To continue to foster this growth, the ATC’s mission has created four subcommittees to add value beyond geography.</span></p><p style="margin:0"></p><ul>
